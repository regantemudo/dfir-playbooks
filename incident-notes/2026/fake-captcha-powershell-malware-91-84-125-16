# Fake reCAPTCHA PowerShell Malware – Real-World Threat Analysis

### Author: Regan Temudo  
### Type: Threat Intelligence / Malware Research  
### Status: Active campaign observed in the wild

---

## Overview

This repository documents a **real-world malware campaign** abusing **fake reCAPTCHA challenges** to socially engineer users into executing **fileless PowerShell malware**.

No malware is hosted here.  
This repository is **analysis-only**.

---

## Infection Flow

1. User visits a compromised website  
2. Fake CAPTCHA overlay appears  
3. User is instructed to press **Windows + R**  
4. A PowerShell command is pasted  
5. Remote payload executes **in memory**  
6. System compromise occurs  

---

## Key Techniques Observed

- Base64-encoded PowerShell  
- String reversal obfuscation  
- `Invoke-Expression`  
- Remote payload execution  
- Error suppression  
- Junk variable padding  

---

## Payload Behavior (High Level)

- Fetches a second-stage script  
- Decodes an obfuscated payload  
- Executes dynamically in memory  
- Leaves minimal disk artifacts  

---

## Why This Matters

This attack:

- Bypasses user skepticism  
- Evades traditional antivirus solutions  
- Requires **zero exploits**  
- Targets **human behavior**, not software vulnerabilities
