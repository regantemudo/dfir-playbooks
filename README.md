## 🔎 Detection Quick Reference

> Ready-to-adapt queries for common SIEM/EDR platforms.

### PowerShell / Fileless Malware
```powershell
# Windows Event Log — ScriptBlock Logging (Event ID 4104)
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational" |
  Where-Object { $_.Message -match "Invoke-Expression|iex\b|-enc\b|91\.84\.125\.16" }

# Sysmon / EDR — suspicious PowerShell launch
CommandLine contains "-enc" AND ParentProcess in ("outlook.exe","chrome.exe","msedge.exe","firefox.exe")
```

### Web Shell Detection
```bash
# Search for web shell indicators in web root
grep -rn "eval(base64_decode\|shell_exec\|system(\|passthru(\|root@xshikata\|create_wp_admin" /var/www/

# Alert on PHP process spawning shell
ParentProcess == "php-fpm" AND ChildProcess in ("bash","sh","cmd.exe","powershell.exe")
```

### C2 Network Hunting
```
# SIEM — outbound to known bad IPs
dst_ip IN ("91.84.125.16", "5.9.228.188") AND direction == "outbound"

# Proxy logs — suspicious path
http.uri_path == "/big.txt" AND http.method == "GET"

# Alert on port 5000 outbound from servers
dst_port == 5000 AND src_zone == "server_dmz"
```

### DNS Tunneling
```
# High-entropy subdomain detection
dns.query.name MATCHES "^[a-z0-9]{25,}\\..*$"
AND dns.query.count > 50 WITHIN 5m
AND dns.query.domain NOT IN (whitelist)
```

### Ransomware Indicators
```
# File extension monitoring
file.extension IN (".gblood") OR
file.name IN ("RESTORE_FILES.txt","DECRYPT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt","HOW_TO_RECOVER_FILES.txt")

# Mass file modification (ransomware encryption behavior)
file.write_count > 500 WITHIN 60s AND process.name NOT IN (backup_tools_whitelist)
```

## 🌍 Live Threat Map

> Visualizing active campaigns, C2 infrastructure, and attacker geography documented in this repo.

![Live Threat Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/regantemudo/dfir-playbooks/main/threat-map.svg)

## Design Principles

- Real campaigns, not hypotheticals
- Defender-first — detection queries and response steps are the priority
- MITRE ATT&CK mapped across all playbooks
- SOC-ready structure for Tier 1–3 analysts
