# ⚠️ DISCLAIMER — SECURITY RESEARCH REPOSITORY

## Purpose

This repository is maintained for **defensive security research, threat intelligence, and incident response education only.**

All content — including malware samples, threat infrastructure documentation, IOCs, and playbooks — is provided solely to help security professionals **detect, analyze, and defend against** real-world threats.

---

## Regarding Malware Samples

This repository contains **collected malware samples** from active threat campaigns observed in the wild. These are stored here for:

- Static analysis and behavior documentation
- IOC extraction and threat intelligence correlation
- Incident response training and playbook development
- Defensive tooling and detection rule development

**All executable files (`.php.sample`, binaries, scripts) have been defanged** — renamed or modified to prevent accidental execution. They are inert for analysis purposes.

> No malware is hosted with the intent to distribute, deploy, or enable attacks.  
> All samples were collected through open-source threat intelligence (OSINT) methods from publicly observable infrastructure.

---

## Legal Notice

- This repository does **not** provide operational attack tooling
- Samples are stored in defanged form and are **not ready-to-execute**
- All threat actor infrastructure references are for **attribution and detection purposes only**
- IOCs are provided to enable **blocking and hunting**, not exploitation
- Victim information referenced from threat actor leak sites is treated as **unverified claims** and is included only for victimology research

**Misuse of any content in this repository for illegal or unauthorized activity is strictly prohibited and is the sole responsibility of the individual.**
